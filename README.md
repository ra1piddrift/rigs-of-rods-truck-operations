# rigs-of-rods-truck-operations

**Small Python-scripted Rigs of rods .truck file editor.**

A simple WIP Python console program to make various operations on a .truck or other Rigs of Rods vehicle file.
Made originally to create trees for the Small Forest Rally (SMFOR) map.  
This program is highly experimental and unfinished, so make sure to keep backups of your files before using this.

## To Run Script

**Install Python 3 to run the script**

Download Python 3 here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Place the main script, truck-operations.py, into a new folder, where you will be moving .truck and other RoR vehicle files into.

When Python is installed, you should be able to double-click on the file to run it.

The program is only able to read any file in the folder it is located in, so you will have to move the vehicle files you want into that folder for it to read it.

Enter 'info' in the first prompt for basic menu navigation help.
