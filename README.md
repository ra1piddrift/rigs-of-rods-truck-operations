# rigs-of-rods-truck-operations
A simple WIP Python console program to make various operations on a .truck or other Rigs of Rods vehicle file. Made originally to create trees for the Small Forest Rally (SMFOR) map.   This program is highly experimental and unfinished, so make sure to keep backups of your files before using this.
